### Pa11y CI Accessibility test runner

Pa11y CI is a CI-centric accessibility test runner, built using [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y).

Pa11y CI runs accessibility tests against multiple URLs and reports on any issues. This used during automated testing of the application and can act as a gatekeeper to stop common WCAG a11y issues from making it to live.

To run against URL's listed in the `.pa11yci.json` configuration file.   

```bash
npm run test:accessibility          // requires app to be running
```
